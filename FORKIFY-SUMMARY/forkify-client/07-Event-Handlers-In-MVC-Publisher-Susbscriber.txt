KEY NOTES: 

        - Problem with current MVC implementation: 
                - The recipeController has UI logic : listening for events(hashchanged ,load)

        SOLUTION: 
                  separate the logics of listening for events(UI LOGIC) 
                  and handling events(Application Logic)


        - Publisher(UI LOGIC - VIEW) : 
                 Knows WHEN to react to an event - but does not know  HOW 

         -Subscriber(APP LOGIC - CONTROLLER)
                Knows HOW to react to an event
        


TASK LITS :

        1.Refactor: Move the logic of listening to events from recipeController 
          into the recipeView new  method : addHandlerRender(handler)

        2.
