    LAST 2 LECTURES I IMPLEMENTED: 
    1) Load Recipe from API 
    2) Render Recipe 
    


  
  KEY NOTES: 

  1.LOADING A RECIPE BASED ON THE HASHCHANGE EVENT OF THE WINDOW OBJECT

      - window.location : the entire URL 
      - 'hash' : the url path  starting with the # 
      - GOURD CLAUSE ON NO HASH(EMPTY HASH ): 
             IF THERE IS NOTHING AFTER THE # IN URL then the entire hash is empty- AND NO RECIPE ID HAS THE EMPTY STRING VALUE IN DB!
             IN THIS CASE :I WILL GET INFINITE SPINNER WITH THE MESSAGE SOMETHING WENT WRONG
             => ADD GOURD CLAUSE - OK
             
      - Simulate a user recipe selection by adding a hardcoded link in the search-results HTML 
      - Add event listener on the hashChanged
      - Read the hash values from the url : window.location.hash
        (instead of loading the same recipe )
      - if no hash in the URL (the URL has # but nothig after- return!)
      - Remove the '#' when there: window.location.slice(1); 
      


  2.LOADING A RECIPE BASED ON THE PAGE LOAD EVENT:
     IMPORTANT!: 
        I NEED TO LISTEN TO THIS EVENT SINCE HASHCHANGED EVENT IS NOT ENOUGH ! 
        WHEN USER COPY THE URL TO ANOTHER BROWSER TAB PAGE!
        THE NEW PAGE WITH THE COPIED URL IN THE ADDRESS BAR - WILL NOT HAVE ANY RECIPE!!

      - Listen to the 'load' event






    NOW: HANDLING THE 2 EVENTS BY RENDERING THE RECIPE 
        - load : page loads with the recipe id in the hash 
        - hashchanged
